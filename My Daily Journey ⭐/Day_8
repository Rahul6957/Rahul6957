📘 Day Blog: Understanding Props in React
📌 What are Props in React?

Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another.
Props make components reusable and dynamic.

👉 Props are read-only (we cannot change them inside the child component).

🔹 Props in Functional Components

In a functional component, props are received as a parameter.

✅ Example 1: Simple Props with Function Component
Parent Component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Student name="Rahul" course="MCA" />
    </div>
  );
}

Child Component
function Student(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Name: {props.name}</h2>
      <p>Course: {props.course}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

📝 Explanation:

App is the parent component

Student is the child component

Data (name, course) is passed as props

We access props using props.propertyName

✅ Example 2: Props using Destructuring (Best Practice)
function Student({ name, course }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Name: {name}</h2>
      <p>Course: {course}</p>
    </div>
  );
}


✔ Cleaner
✔ Easy to read
✔ Mostly used in real projects

🔹 Props in Class Components

In class components, props are accessed using this.props.

✅ Example: Props with Class Component
Parent Component
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Teacher subject="React" experience="3 Years" />
    </div>
  );
}

Child Component
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Teacher extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Subject: {this.props.subject}</h2>
        <p>Experience: {this.props.experience}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Teacher;

📝 Explanation:

In class components, we must use this.props

Props work the same way as function components

Only the syntax is different

🔑 Key Points to Remember

Props are used to send data from parent to child

Props are immutable (read-only)

Functional Component → props or destructuring

Class Component → this.props

Props help in reusability of components

💡 Real-Life Example

Think of props like:

📦 Gift from parent to child
Child can use the gift but cannot change it 🎁

✅ Conclusion

Props are one of the most important concepts in React.
Understanding props clearly helps you build dynamic, reusable, and clean components.
