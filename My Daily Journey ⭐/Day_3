Day 3: Understanding React State & Props 🚀

Hello everyone,
Welcome back to my learning journey. This is Day 3 of learning React, and honestly, today felt like a turning point.

On Day 1, everything was new.
On Day 2, things started making sense.
But Day 3 is where I began to think in React.

📌 What I learned today

Today, I focused on two very important concepts in React:

1. Props
Props help us pass data from one component to another.
I understood that props make components reusable and dynamic, instead of hard-coding values every time.

2. State
State is used to manage data inside a component.
This concept really changed the way I look at UI.
I realized that when the state changes, the UI automatically updates — and that’s the real power of React.

🧠 My thoughts

At first, state and props felt confusing.
I made mistakes, I got errors, and yes — I Googled a lot 😅
But slowly, things started connecting.

Today I understood one important thing:

React is not about memorizing code, it’s about understanding how data flows.

💪 Why this day matters

Day 3 gave me confidence.
Confidence that I can learn this.
Confidence that I am moving forward, even if it’s slow.

Every small concept I understand today is a step closer to becoming a better developer tomorrow.

🔜 What’s next

Tomorrow, I’ll dive deeper into events, conditional rendering, and more practice.
The journey continues, and I’m not stopping.

If you’re reading this and learning something new too —
keep going. We’ll get there.

See you in Day 4 ✨
Kal fir milenge 😉
