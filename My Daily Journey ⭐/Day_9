Day Blog: Learning Input Box, Props, State & Basic Form in React

Today was a good React day 💻✨
I learned some important core concepts that every React developer must know.

Instead of just reading theory, I tried to understand how things work practically.

🔹 1. Input Box in React

In React, input box is not just HTML.
We usually connect it with state so React can control the data.

Example:

const [data, setData] = useState("");

<input 
  type="text" 
  value={data} 
  onChange={(e) => setData(e.target.value)} 
/>


👉 This is called a controlled component
👉 React always knows what is inside the input box

🔹 2. State in React (useState)

State is used to store and update data in a component.

Example:

const [show, setShow] = useState(false);


show → current value

setShow → function to update value

When state changes, component re-renders automatically 🔁

🔹 3. Function Component

React components are just JavaScript functions.

Example:

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React</h1>;
}


👉 Function components are:

easy to write

easy to understand

widely used in modern React

🔹 4. Props (Single & Multiple)

Props are used to send data from parent to child component.

Single prop:
<User name="Rahul" />

Multiple props:
<User name="Rahul" age="22" email="rahul@gmail.com" />


Inside child component:

function User(props) {
  return (
    <h2>{props.name} - {props.age}</h2>
  );
}


👉 Props are read-only
👉 They help components communicate

🔹 5. Handling Input with Button (Real Use Case)

I learned how to:

take input

store it in state

show it on button click

Example:

{show && <h1>{data}</h1>}
<button onClick={() => setShow(true)}>Print Data</button>


This helped me understand conditional rendering.

🔹 6. Basic HTML Form in React

React forms use:

onSubmit

preventDefault()

Example:

function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  console.log(data);
}


👉 Prevents page reload
👉 React handles form smoothly

✅ What I Learned Today

✔ Input box handling
✔ useState hook
✔ Function components
✔ Single & multiple props
✔ Conditional rendering
✔ Basic form handling

🧠 Final Thoughts

Today’s learning made me more confident in React basics.
These concepts are foundation for real projects.

Slow progress is still progress 🚀
Tomorrow I will practice more and build better components.
