This is not a “perfect developer” story.
This is a learner’s story.
Day 4: still making mistakes, still learning, still moving forward.



Day 4: React, Errors, Confidence & Chai ☕💻

Hello everyone,
Welcome back to Day 4 of my React journey — and trust me, today was spicy 🌶️

Not too easy.
Not too hard.
Just the kind of day that teaches you patience.

🎯 What happened today

Today, I spent most of my time practicing, not just learning.

I worked on:

Event handling

Conditional rendering

Writing logic inside components

Fixing my own mistakes (again and again 😅)

Sometimes the code worked.
Sometimes it didn’t.
And sometimes… it worked after chai ☕😌

😵 The struggle part (real talk)

Let me be honest —
I faced errors that made no sense at first.

One small bracket ❌
One wrong spelling ❌
And boom… red screen.

But instead of getting angry, I learned something important today:

Errors are not enemies, they are teachers in disguise.

🧠 The learning part

Today I understood that:

React rewards logic, not copy-paste

Practice builds confidence

Small wins matter a lot

Even fixing a tiny bug felt like a mini victory 🏆

🔥 The motivation

Day 4 reminded me why I started this journey.

Not to be perfect.
Not to be fast.
But to be better than yesterday.

Some people scroll reels.
Some people scroll code.
I chose code 😄

🚀 What’s coming next

Tomorrow, I’ll focus more on hands-on projects, clean code, and deeper understanding.
Slow progress, but solid progress.

If you’re learning too —
Don’t quit on Day 4.
Day 5 is waiting 😉

See you soon,
Day 5 loading… ⏳
Kal fir milenge dost 🤝✨
