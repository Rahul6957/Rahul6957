Hello everyone 👋
Welcome back to my learning journey.

Today, I learned one of the most important concepts in React — State.
At first, the word state sounded serious 😅, but after practicing, it became clear and interesting.

🤔 What is State in React?

In simple words, state is used to store data that can change over time.
When the state changes, React automatically updates the UI.
This is what makes React fast and dynamic.

Example:

Button click count

User input text

Toggle (ON / OFF)
All these need state.

🧠 Why State is Important?

Before state, I was thinking:

“How does React know when data changes?”

Now I understand:
👉 State tells React when to re-render the component.

Without state:

No interaction

No dynamic UI

Just static pages 😴

🛠️ Small Example
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increase
      </button>
    </>
  );
}


This example helped me understand:

count → current state value

setCount → function to update state

useState(0) → initial value

💡 What I Learned Today

✅ State stores changing data
✅ useState hook is used in functional components
✅ Updating state updates UI automatically
✅ React feels more powerful now 💪

🚀 Final Thoughts

Today’s learning gave me more confidence in React.
Slowly, concepts are connecting, and things are making sense.

I know the journey is long, but step by step, I’m moving forward.

👉 Tomorrow, I’ll explore props or events (let’s see 😉)

See you in the next blog — stay tuned! 🙌🔥
